      <div>Calamari is a common appetizer or side dish in restaurants made from squid. Despite being made from squid, it differs because calamari refers to the edible parts of the squid. The edible parts include the body, tentacles, and fins. The squid's body is then split into rings, tossed in breading, and lastly fried. Once it's done, the calamari is finished and ready for eating. </div>

      <div>Calamari originates from the Italian word "calamaro", which translates to squid. Fried calamari originated from Italy, but eventually it spread to the United States leading it to spread worldwide. Other cultures, such as Japan also have calamari, but it is instead called "ika". It came to the United States in 1975, first being served in luxury restaurants. However in the 1980s, it slowly became common in regular restaurants. In the following decade, calamari reached nearly every restaurant prepared as a fried appetizer to appeal to customers.</div>
